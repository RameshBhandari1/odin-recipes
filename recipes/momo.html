    <h2>Momo: The Iconic Dumpling of Nepal</h2>
    <p>
      Momo, a cherished dish in Nepal, is a type of dumpling that has become a
      staple in Nepali cuisine. It is believed to have been introduced by
      Tibetan immigrants, but it has since been fully embraced and adapted by
      the people of Nepal. These dumplings are filled with a variety of
      ingredients, most commonly minced meat like chicken, buffalo, or pork,
      mixed with flavorful spices and herbs. Momo can be steamed, fried, or even
      served in a soup, making it a versatile and beloved street food or family
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret to Momo's distinct flavor lies in its spiced filling, which
      includes a mix of ginger, garlic, onions, and a dash of spices like cumin
      and garam masala. Momo is often served with a tangy dipping sauce made
      from tomatoes, sesame seeds, and chili, adding an extra layer of heat and
      richness. Whether enjoyed as a snack or part of a larger meal, Momo
      represents the heart of Nepali comfort food, offering a satisfying
      combination of textures and tastes that are sure to delight.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Cabbage, carrots, and sometimes mushrooms
        (for vegetarian momo)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauces:</strong> Soy sauce, sesame oil, and a tangy tomato-based
        dipping sauce (with chili, garlic, and sesame seeds)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the filling:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, combine
        the minced meat (or vegetables for a vegetarian version) with finely
        chopped garlic, ginger, onions, and green onions. Add spices like cumin,
        coriander, garam masala, turmeric, and chili powder to the mixture.
        Optionally, add finely chopped vegetables like cabbage or carrots for
        added texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the dough:</strong> In another bowl, mix together
        all-purpose flour, water, and a pinch of salt to form a smooth, elastic
        dough. Knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes soft and
        pliable. Cover with a damp cloth and let it rest for 15-20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Form the momo wrappers:</strong> Divide the dough into small,
        equal-sized balls. Roll each ball into a thin round wrapper, about 3-4
        inches in diameter. Make sure the edges are thinner than the center to
        allow easy folding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Fill the momo:</strong> Place a spoonful of the filling in the
        center of each wrapper. Carefully fold the edges to create a pleated,
        half-moon shape, pinching the sides to seal the momo. If making round
        momos, pinch the edges together to form a closed pouch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steam the momos:</strong> Prepare a steamer by lining the base
        with parchment paper or lightly greasing it to prevent sticking. Arrange
        the momos in the steamer basket, ensuring they do not touch each other.
        Steam for 12-15 minutes, or until the dough becomes firm and the filling
        is cooked through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Once steamed, remove the momos from the steamer
        and let them cool for a few minutes. Serve hot with a tangy dipping
        sauce made from tomatoes, sesame seeds, garlic, and chili, or enjoy them
        with achar for an added punch of flavor.
