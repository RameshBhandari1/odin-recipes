    <h2>Keema Noodles: A Nepali Culinary Fusion</h2>
    <p>
      Keema Noodles, a beloved dish in Nepal, blend South Asian spices with East
      Asian noodle traditions, creating a hearty and flavorful meal. Originating
      from regions like Boudha, a hub for Tibetan and Nepali cuisine, this dish
      features spiced minced meat (often chicken, lamb, or beef) stir-fried with
      vegetables and noodles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Nepali version is distinguished by its use of local spices like
      <em>Timur</em>
      (Szechuan pepper) and chili flakes, which add a unique numbing heat and
      aroma. Influenced by Tibetan and Chinese culinary practices, it balances
      savory umami from soy sauce with fresh crunch from vegetables like pak
      choi and spring onions, making it a popular street food and comfort dish.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Minced meat:</strong> (chicken, beef, or lamb)</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Noodles:</strong> (traditionally Chinese-style egg noodles or
        spaghetti)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Aromatics:</strong> Garlic, ginger, onions, and spring onions
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices:</strong> Timur (Szechuan pepper), red chili powder,
        chili flakes, cumin, and meat masala
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Pak choi, cabbage, carrots, bell peppers
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauces:</strong> Soy sauce, tomato puree, and mustard oil (for
        authentic flavor)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the noodles:</strong> Cook the noodles according to
        package instructions, then drain and set aside. If youâ€™re using egg
        noodles, rinse them in cold water to prevent sticking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the minced meat:</strong> In a large pan or wok, heat a
        tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Add the minced meat (chicken,
        beef, or lamb) and cook until browned, breaking it up into small pieces.
        Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the aromatics:</strong> While the meat is cooking, chop
        garlic, ginger, and onions finely. Once the meat is browned, add the
        chopped garlic and ginger to the pan, stirring until fragrant (about 1
        minute). Then, add the onions and cook until they become soft and
        translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the spices:</strong> Sprinkle in cumin, meat masala, red
        chili powder, chili flakes, and Timur (Szechuan pepper). Stir to combine
        and let the spices bloom for a couple of minutes, infusing the meat with
        the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the vegetables:</strong> Add the sliced bell peppers,
        cabbage, carrots, and pak choi to the pan. Stir-fry the vegetables for
        2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp and coated in the spiced meat
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the noodles:</strong> Once the vegetables are cooked, add
        the cooked noodles to the pan. Toss the noodles with the meat and
        vegetables, ensuring everything is evenly mixed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season with sauces:</strong> Drizzle soy sauce and tomato puree
        over the noodles and toss again. If you want a more authentic flavor,
        you can also add a little mustard oil. Continue to stir-fry everything
        together for another 2-3 minutes until the noodles are well coated and
        heated through.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Once everything is thoroughly mixed and the
        noodles are hot, remove from heat. Serve the Keema Noodles hot,
        garnished with freshly chopped spring onions and a sprinkle of chili
        flakes if you like extra heat. Enjoy this flavorful fusion dish as a
        hearty meal or snack!
