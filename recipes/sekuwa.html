    <h2>Sekuwa: Nepali Grilled Meat Skewers</h2>
    <p>
      Sekuwa is a popular street food in Nepal, known for its rich flavors and
      smoky aroma. These skewered meats, typically made from chicken, goat, or
      buffalo, are marinated in a blend of Nepali spices and herbs before being
      grilled over an open flame. The marination process ensures that the meat
      absorbs the depth of flavors, which are enhanced by the smoky grilling
      method. Sekuwa is often served with a side of achar (Nepali pickle) and
      salad, making it a delicious and satisfying dish that's perfect for casual
      gatherings or celebrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret to a great Sekuwa lies in its marination. The meat is often
      coated with a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, cumin, coriander,
      turmeric, and other spices like garam masala and fenugreek. This blend
      gives the meat its tender texture and bold flavor. Once grilled to
      perfection, Sekuwa offers a smoky, slightly charred outer layer with
      juicy, tender meat inside. It's one of the quintessential flavors of
      Nepali cuisine, loved for its balance of spice, smokiness, and savory
      goodness.

        coriander, and garam masala
      </li>

        <strong>Spices:</strong> Fenugreek, red chili powder, timur (Szechuan
        pepper), and salt
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Herbs:</strong> Fresh cilantro, fresh lemon juice, and green
        chilies (optional for added heat)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grilling:</strong> Mustard oil or ghee (for brushing while
        grilling)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sides:</strong> Achar (Nepali pickle), fresh salad, or a squeeze
        of lime
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the marinade:</strong> In a large bowl, mix together
        yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, cumin, coriander, garam masala,
        fenugreek, red chili powder, timur, and salt. Adjust the spice levels
        based on your preference.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate the meat:</strong> Add the cut pieces of meat into the
        marinade, making sure each piece is thoroughly coated. Cover and let the
        meat marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for
        more flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare the skewers:</strong> Thread the marinated meat onto
        wooden or metal skewers. If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for
        30 minutes beforehand to prevent burning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Preheat the grill:</strong> Heat your grill to a medium-high
        temperature. If using a charcoal grill, let the coals turn white-hot for
        an even cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Grill the Sekuwa:</strong> Brush the skewers with mustard oil or
        ghee and place them on the grill. Cook for 10-15 minutes, turning
        occasionally until the meat is fully cooked and slightly charred on the
        outside. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C) for chicken,
        or a similar appropriate temperature for other meats.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Once cooked, remove the skewers from the grill
        and let them rest for a few minutes. Serve hot with achar, fresh salad,
        and a squeeze of lime for extra zing.
      </li>
